						<p>So day one of KCDC, day two if you've been at the precompilers. How is it?
						Have you seen some amazing talks? How do they make you feel? Are you inspired?</p>
						<p>Being at a technical conference can be a wonderful thing. You get to hear from
							brilliant speakers, hear about exciting new technologies, and share the passion
							for your craft with those around you. The halls buzz with excitement and chatter,
							it can be hard not to walk away feeling empowered.
						</p>
						<p>Are you ready to change the world? Are you raring to going to go home and try that
							new</p>

					<h4 class="fragment">And Tuesday?</h4>
					<h5 class="fragment">And Wednesday?</h5>
					<h6 class="fragment">And next week?</h6>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Slowly, these feelings may start to fade. Will you return to the regular pace of your day?
							Will you realize your team isn't ready to implement that new deployment process you were so inspired by?
							Will you remember how you felt during that talk that validated the way you write code, or lead a team,
							or make technical decisions?
						</p>
						<p>When you're on support duty next week working on bugs, will you be putting those newly learned best-practice
							techniques to use?
							Will you still be working on that side project you were inspired to change the world with after seeing
							that awesome Arduino demo about dogs sending selfies?
						Will you still be sharing insights you learned at KCDC with your significant other at the dinner table?</p>

						<p>Slowly, these feelings may start to fade. Will you return to the regular pace of your day?
							Will you realize your team isn't ready to implement that new framework you were so inspired by?
							Will you remember how you felt during that talk that validated the way you write code, or lead a team,
							or make technical decisions? When will you return to the hum drum of completing those tickets in your
							sprint and picking up the kids from daycare and remembering to get the propane tank and was that
							kid's birthday party on Saturday or Sunday and did I respond to that email and why is QA not seeing
							the changes I just deployed?
