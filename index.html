						<p>So day one of KCDC, day two if you've been at the precompilers. How is it?
						Have you seen some amazing talks? How do they make you feel? Are you inspired?</p>
						<p>Being at a technical conference can be a wonderful thing. You get to hear from
							brilliant speakers, hear about exciting new technologies, and share the passion
							for your craft with those around you. The halls buzz with excitement and chatter,
							it can be hard not to walk away feeling empowered.
						</p>
						<p>Are you ready to change the world? Are you raring to going to go home and try that
							new tech stack? Are you inpsired?</p>

					<h6 class="fragment">And the next week?</h6>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Slowly, these feelings may start to fade. Will you return to the regular pace of your day?
							Will you realize your team isn't ready to implement that new deployment process you were so inspired by?
							Will you remember how you felt during that talk that validated the way you write code, or lead a team,
							or make technical decisions? When will you return to the hum drum of completing those tickets in your
							sprint and picking up the kids from daycare and remembering to get the propane tank and was that
							kid's birthday party on Saturday or Sunday and did I respond to that email and why is QA not seeing
							the changes I just deployed?
						</p>
						<p>When you're on support duty next week working on bugs, will you be putting those newly learned best-practice
							techniques to use?
							Will you still be working on that side project you were inspired to change the world with after seeing
							that awesome Arduino demo about dogs sending selfies?
						Will you still be sharing insights you learned at KCDC with your significant other at the dinner table?</p>

						<h2>Maslow's Hierarchy</h2>

							<img class="fragment current-visible" data-fragment-index="1" src="img/Maslow2.png" />

						<aside class="notes">
							Acceptance. Maslow's freaking heirarchy.
							<br /><br />
							If you've never taken a psych class, I'll give you a crash course.
							<br/><br />
							In 1943 Maslow stated that people are motivated to achieve certain needs. When one need is
							fulfilled a person seeks to fullfil the next one, and so on. So he created this pyramid model
							- splitting needs into 5 levels.
							<br /><br />
							The most basic is <b>physiological</b> - health, food, sleep... the most rudimentary things
							we need to survive. Once those needs are satisfied, we move on to <b>safety</b>.
							<br /><br />
							We search for shelter, removal from danger, stability, freedom from fear. Fortunalely for us,
							this is already taken care of, at least until the impending zombie apocalypse occurs. In that
							case, I'm sure most people watch enough Walking Dead to know what NOT to do to survive.
							<br /><br />
							So once we're fed, on a diet of Mountain Dew and Dortios, of course, and safe, the next thing
							we look for is acceptance. There really is a biological reason behind needing to feel as though
							you belong to a group.
							<br /><br />
							In early days of humanity, being a part of a group was necessary to survive. We were hunters
							and gatherers that shared food and cared for offspring in groups. We created and shared tools.
							If you were different in any way, or stood out, you would be cast from the group, and die on
							your own. That's why we're programmed to fear rejection - it's biological.
							<br /><br />
							So we've established it is as simple as just a human need to feel <b>accepted</b> and to be part
							of a community. The next thing we strive for is self-esteem, confidence, achievement - respect from ourself and others.
							<br /><br />
							If you don't have a community that can relate to your achievements, you may have a hard time
							fulfilling this need. At my first job, I was the only designer/developer. There was no basis
							for my level of achievement. As far as the client managers were concerned, I sat in my cube doing
							magic having graduated from the university of Hogwarts School of Webery. When I accomplished
							anything, there was nothing to compare it to, therefor no sense of achievement or self worth.
							Granted this was also before twitter took off and my only connection to anything relevant in
							the web industry was reading SmashingMagazine.com.
							<br /><br />
							Developer Communities are important in that they fill a need for acceptance, and give us a sense
							of belonging to others who understand what we do, and why it's so awesome. Let's be real - I love
							being a developer, and I'm sure you do too, that's why you're here. Being a part of a community
							who understands what you do can help you access your validity and skill level.
							<br /><br />
							The very top level is <b>self-actualization</b> - achieving your potential. According to Maslow,
							a person is always “becoming” and never remains static in these terms. In self-actualization a
							person comes to find a meaning to life that is important to them. I don't run into many developers
							who are happy with how they are now; they're always looking to learn, grow, and improve. This may
							explain the discontent you feel when you're doing maintenance, or on a project that doesn't require
							any learning or growth.

					<h2>Community</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<b>com·mu·ni·ty [kuh-myoo-ni-tee]</b>
						<br /><br />

					</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
							Community is defined as "a social, religious, occupational, or other group sharing common characteristics or interests and perceived or perceiving itself as distinct in some respect from the larger society within which it exists".
							<br /><br />
							So we are an occupationals group with common characteristics, and in all likelyhood shared interests.
							Let's now talk about existing communities you may or may not be aware of. We're first going to look inside the workplace, as you probably spend a minimum of 40 hours a week there.

					<h2>5-7pm</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						So here's the BIG CTA. Just one step. Come to the attendee party tonight.
						If you've got kids to take care of, text or call your significant other, and
						ask nicely to take a few hours to network. Does your cat need to be fed?
						Text a roommate or friend. D&amp;D group meeting? Ok, I don't know if I can talk you
						into blowing that off, I know how hardcore my friends are about that night. But you
						should come anyway.
						Tell that speaker how much you enjoyed their talk. Take the chance to pick their brain.
						Talk to someone new. Reconnect with someone old. And finally,
						be inspired by someone else's story, or better yet, inspire someone with you own.
						Come join the community.
